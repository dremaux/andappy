# Running Imagine tests

In order to run Imagine tests, enter the root directory of Imagine (the one that contains `composer.json`) and execute the following command:

```sh
composer install
composer test
```

Imagine uses phpunit to perform the tests.  


### Passing arguments to phpunit

You can pass options to phpunit by adding them after a `--`:

```sh
composer test -- --filter=DrawerTest
```

please remark that the `--` have to be specified just once, even if you pass more options to phpunit:

```sh
composer test -- --filter=DrawerTest --colors=never
```


### Filtering tests by group

Imagine tests may be part of one or more groups.
Currently defined groups are:
- `always-skipped` these tests will always be marked as skipped
- `gd` tests that require the GD php extension
- `gmagick` tests that require the Gmagick php extension
- `imagick` tests that require the Imagick php extension

For example, you can skip the tests that will always be skipped and the tests that require Gmagick by running:

```sh
composer test -- --exclude-group=always-skipped,gmagick
```


### Test temporary files

Imagine tests often save temporary files to the `tests/tmp` folder.
These files are deleted once test completes.
In order to see what's actually gets generated by tests, you can set the `IMAGINE_TEST_KEEP_TEMPFILES` environment directory to a non falsy value.

For example, with POSIX systems you can run:

```sh
IMAGINE_TEST_KEEP_TEMPFILES=1 composer test
```

or

```sh
export IMAGINE_TEST_KEEP_TEMPFILES=1
composer test
```

With Windows systems you can run:

```sh
set IMAGINE_TEST_KEEP_TEMPFILES=1
composer test
```
